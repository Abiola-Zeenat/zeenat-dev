# About Me

## Building Digital Solutions, One API at a Time

I'm Abiola Abdulsalam, a backend developer intern at Edusproute with a unique background in Mechanical Engineering from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (Second Class Upper Division, CGPA: 4.28/5.00).

### My Journey

My transition from mechanical engineering to software development reflects my passion for problem-solving and building efficient systems. While mechanical engineering taught me precision and systematic thinking, backend development allows me to apply these principles to create scalable digital solutions.

### Current Focus

At Edusproute, I'm working with Express.js and TypeScript, implementing Object-Oriented Programming patterns to develop robust backend services. My responsibilities include:

- Developing and maintaining backend services with scalable architecture
- Designing optimized server-side logic for enhanced performance and security
- Collaborating with frontend developers for seamless API integration
- Managing database operations and optimizing query performance
- Writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code

### Skills & Expertise

**Backend Technologies**
- Node.js & Express.js for server-side development
- TypeScript & JavaScript for type-safe, scalable code
- MongoDB & MySQL for database management
- JWT & OAuth for secure authentication

**Development Practices**
- RESTful API design and implementation
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Server-side debugging & optimization
- Version control with Git & GitHub

**Additional Skills**
- Frontend development with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & ReactJS
- API documentation and testing with Postman

### Previous Experience

Before focusing on backend development, I completed a frontend internship at Egglin Community (February 2023 - July 2023), where I collaborated with UI/UX designers to create responsive web pages. This experience gave me a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development.

### Certifications

- Backend Node.js Certification – Edusproute (Dec 2024)
- Backend Web Development (C#) – CodeVixens Academy (Dec 2023)
- JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures – FreeCodeCamp (Nov 2023)
- Front-end Development Internship – Egglin Community (July 2023)
- Responsive Web Design – FreeCodeCamp (Jan 2022)

### Philosophy

I believe in writing code that's not just functional but elegant and maintainable. Every API endpoint, every database query, and every authentication flow should be crafted with care, keeping scalability and security at the forefront.
